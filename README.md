# Cognitive Distortion Generator Model

## Project Overview

The Cognitive Distortion Detection project aims to develop a sophisticated model capable of identifying cognitive distortions present in text data related to individuals' mental health experiences. Cognitive distortions are common thinking patterns associated with various mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. Detecting these distortions is crucial for providing effective support and intervention to individuals experiencing mental health issues.

### Objectives

- **Model Development**: Develop a robust model using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo framework for accurately detecting cognitive distortions in text data.
- **Data Collection**: Gather diverse datasets from platforms like Kaggle containing text data reflecting individuals' experiences with mental health issues. These datasets serve as the foundation for training the model.
- **Prompt Definition**: Create unique definitions for each cognitive distortion as prompts in OpenAI to enhance the model's efficiency in recognizing distortions.
- **Analysis Automation**: Develop automated processes to preprocess input data, generate cognitive distortions using the model, and analyze distortion patterns across a large dataset.
- **Scalability and Applicability**: Ensure the model's scalability and applicability in real-world scenarios by optimizing data preprocessing, model training, and distortion generation processes.

## Methodology

### Dataset Collection

Multiple datasets are gathered from platforms like Kaggle, containing text data related to individuals' experiences with mental health issues. These datasets serve as the foundation for training the model, providing diverse examples of cognitive distortions in natural language.

### Model Development

OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo framework is utilized as the primary tool for developing the cognitive distortion detection model. The model is trained using the collected datasets to ensure accurate pattern detection and classification of cognitive distortions in text data.

### Prompt Definition

To enhance the efficiency of the model in recognizing cognitive distortions, unique definitions are created for each distortion as prompts in OpenAI. These prompts provide specific cues for the model to identify the dominant distortion within each text data entry, improving the accuracy of the generated output.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for model development and data preprocessing.
- **OpenAI**: Leveraged for developing the cognitive distortion detection model using GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- **Regex**: Employed for text data cleaning, including removal of brackets, emojis, and numbers.
- **CSV**: Used for data storage and handling during the distortion generation process.

## What

### Prompt Generation

I developed a function `prompt_generator` to construct prompts for OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. This function dynamically generates prompts based on the primary distortion and input text. By providing tailored prompts, the model can better understand and generate accurate cognitive distortions.

### AI Cognitive Distortion Producer

Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, I created the `AICogDisProducer` function. This function generates cognitive distortions for given text inputs. Leveraging the power of AI, the model produces nuanced distortions, enhancing the depth and accuracy of the generated output.

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the input data for the model, I implemented data preprocessing steps. This involved cleaning the text data by removing unwanted characters such as brackets, emojis, and numbers. By ensuring the input data's cleanliness, I optimized the model's performance and output quality.

### Cognitive Distortion Generation

I developed the `CogGenerator` function to automate the generation of cognitive distortions for a large dataset of tweets. This function iterates over the preprocessed data, generates distortions using the AI model, and saves the results for further analysis. By efficiently processing a significant volume of data, I facilitated the exploration of cognitive distortion patterns.

## Why

### Tailored Prompts

Constructing tailored prompts allows the model to focus on specific cognitive distortions present in the input text. By customizing prompts based on the primary distortion, I aimed to improve the model's ability to generate relevant and accurate distortions, enhancing its utility in mental health analysis.

### AI-Driven Distortion Generation

Integrating OpenAI's powerful language model enables the automated generation of cognitive distortions. By leveraging AI, I aimed to capture the nuanced nuances of cognitive distortions present in text data, facilitating deeper insights into individuals' thought patterns and mental health experiences.

### Data Optimization

Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality of input data for the model. By implementing preprocessing steps, I aimed to enhance the model's performance by providing clean and standardized input data. This optimization contributes to more reliable and meaningful distortion generation results.

### Scalable Distortion Analysis

The `CogGenerator` function enables the efficient analysis of cognitive distortions across a large dataset of tweets. By automating the distortion generation process, I aimed to scale the analysis, allowing for comprehensive exploration of distortion patterns and their prevalence in the dataset. This scalability enhances the model's applicability in real-world scenarios.

## Achievements

- **Tailored Input Handling**: By crafting custom prompts, I enhanced the model's ability to understand and generate distortions specific to different cognitive patterns, improving its accuracy and relevance.
- **Advanced Distortion Generation**: Leveraging OpenAI's language model, I achieved sophisticated distortion generation, capturing subtle nuances and complexities present in the input text.
- **Data Quality Optimization**: Through data preprocessing, I ensured the input data's cleanliness and standardization, resulting in improved model performance and output quality.
- **Scalable Analysis Capability**: With the automated distortion generation process, I achieved efficient analysis across a large dataset, enabling comprehensive exploration of distortion patterns and facilitating deeper insights into mental health issues.

Through these coding efforts, I've developed a robust cognitive distortion generator model that enhances understanding and analysis of mental health-related text data, contributing to the broader goal of leveraging AI for mental health support and analysis.

## Future Directions

- **Refinement of the Model**: Continuously train the model with additional datasets to improve its accuracy and adaptability to diverse text data.
